🏗️ Structural Defects Detection Using AI

An AI-powered application that analyzes construction site images to automatically detect and classify structural defects such as honeycombing, cracks, spalling, and exposed reinforcement. The system generates detailed inspection reports including defect type, severity, impact, and recommended corrective actions, helping engineers improve quality control and safety in construction projects.
